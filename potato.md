# Best Baked Potato

This recipe has been passed down in my family for generations, and I will probably be **ex-commmunicated** from the potato cult if they find out I have shared it with you. Nonetheless, I seem you are worthy to hold this sacred knowledge, and therefore entrust you with the secret of the crusty potato.

## Ingredients

* Potato
* Butter
* Bacon bits
* Green onion
* Cheddar Cheese
* Sour cream, if you're a barbarian (technically not a part of the secret recipe, but it will be allowed this **once**)


## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350
2. Wrap potato in tin foil. You do keep tin foil in your kitchen, right?
3. Put potato in oven. Close door of oven. Leave the potato alone for awhile, it needs time with it's thoughts.
4. Come back to the potato and free it from it's oven-cage after about 2 hours. It missed you!
5. Slather the in butter and dress it in the finest green onion, bacon bits, and cheese mixture you ever did see. Let the potato bask in it's finery for you. Treat the potato tenderly. Worship the potato. You are now inducted into the secret cult of The Spud. What, did you think you were going to eat the Potato? **You monster!**
